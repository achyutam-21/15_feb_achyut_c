C and C++ are two of the most popular programming languages used for system programming and application development.

•  C was developed in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs as a general-purpose, imperative language. It is a mid-
level programming language, meaning that it provides direct access to the computer's hardware, and its syntax is
relatively simple and compact. C is often used for operating systems, embedded systems, and other performance-
critical applications where low-level hardware access and performance are critical.

•  C++ is an extension of C that was developed in the 1980s by Bjarne Stroustrup. It is an object-oriented
programming language, which means it is designed to work with classes and objects. C++ has many features that
C does not have, including classes, templates, and inheritance, making it a more versatile language for software
development. C++ is used for a wide range of applications, including operating systems, games, scientific
simulations, and high-performance software.

Both C and C++ are widely used because they provide low-level access to computer hardware, which makes them
useful for developing operating systems and other software that require direct hardware control. Additionally, they
are relatively fast, efficient, and portable across different platforms. However, they require more effort and
expertise to learn and use than higher-level languages like Python or Java.

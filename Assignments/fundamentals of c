C is a general-purpose programming language that was developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell
Labs. It is a procedural programming language, which means it follows a step-by-step approach to solving
problems.

Here are some of the fundamentals of the C programming language:

1. Data Types: C has several data types such as int, float, double, char, and others. These data types are used to
declare variables that hold values of different types.

2. Variables: Variables are containers that hold values of different data types. In C, variables must be declared
before they are used.

3. Control Structures: C provides several control structures such as if-else statements, loops, and switch
statements that help in controlling the flow of the program.

4. Functions: Functions are blocks of code that perform specific tasks. C allows the creation of user-defined
functions as well as built-in functions.

5. Pointers: Pointers are variables that store memory addresses. They are used to manipulate data directly in
memory, which makes them very powerful.

6. Arrays: Arrays are collections of elements of the same data type. They are used to store and manipulate
multiple values under a single variable name.

7. Input and Output: C provides several functions for input and output such as scanf() and printf().

8. Preprocessor Directives: Preprocessor directives are special commands that start with the # symbol. They are
used to modify the source code before it is compiled.

9. Comments: Comments are used to document code and make it easier to understand. In C, comments start
with /* and end with */ or start with // and continue until the end of the line.

These are some of the basic fundamentals of the C programming language. Mastery of these concepts will enable
you to create complex programs that solve a wide range of problems.
